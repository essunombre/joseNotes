Software Development Life Cycleare diveded in 2 large Groups, Traditional adn AGILE

1. Requirement Definition
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Coding
5. Assurance
6. Development
7. Maintenance  

## Software Development Methodologies
### "Traditional" SDLC Models

- Waterfall Model, implies a sequential flow, each must be fully completed before the next one starts. Not flexible. With uncertanty detailes must be refined while working on the project.
1. Requirements
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Coding  / Implementation
5. Testing
6. Operation / Deployment
7. Maintenance  

- V-Model, has testing in early stages, so defects can be identified earlier. Saves time and money. Not flexible. If a mistake was made during the development of architecture,  fixing it will be expensive.
1. Requirements - Acceptance Testing
2. System Req-Specification - SystemIintegration Testing 
3. High Level Design - Component Testing
4. Low level design - Unit Testing
5. Coding

- Incremental Model: consumes a lot of time, is expensive.

- Iterative Model: Meaning it wont be the final version, but after the fgisrt version the steps are repeated over and over.
1. Detailed Design
2. Development 
3. Testing
4. Delivery


## The Software Testing Lifecycle (STLC)
- Requirement Analysis
- Test Planning
- TestCase Development
- Environment Setup
- Test Execution
- Test Cycle Closure
